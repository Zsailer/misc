# Miscellaneous python scripts/modules for random tasks

These are random scripts produced for various tasks along the way. Each script should have useful documentations within the scripts themselves. No other official documentation, sorry!

You can **clone** and **install** this repo, or just import individual modules from these repo using [antipackage](https://github.com/ellisonbg/antipackage).
