# Miscellaneous python scripts/modules

These are random scripts I've written for my research/work along the way. Each script should have thorough documentation describing what it does. No other official documentation, sorry!

You can **clone** and **install** this repo, or just import individual modules from these repo using [antipackage](https://github.com/ellisonbg/antipackage).
